    "This is a reading and discussion group. If you don’t do the reading before, you will gain very little from discussion sessions. Therefore, we strongly suggest that you put two 50-minute study sessions on your calendar before each discussion. You can claim CPEs for these sessions.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ‘Fire Hose’ lectures (being talked at) do not work\n",
    "- Repetition (specifically, rereading) doesn’t work. As a simple example, take the penny memory test: http://www.indiana.edu/~p1013447/dictionary/penny.htm. Did you get it right? You see pennies every day, but repetitive observation isn’t the most effective way to learn. \n",
    "- Instead, cognitive science suggests that repeated testing results in learning. Repeated testing can come in the form of quizzes, solving practice problems, and using flash cards. Our discussion groups emphasize repeated testing.\n"

If you would like to read ahead, please do that. But please don’t distract others!\n"
